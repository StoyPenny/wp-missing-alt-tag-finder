# WordPress Missing Alt Tag Finder
Easily find images with missing alt tags on your WordPress powered website.

This plugin will look through your uploaded images in your WordPress Media Library and will create a list of the ones that are missing alt tags. This plugin does not scan the front-end of your website, so manually coded images, plugin images, and theme images will not be detected here.
